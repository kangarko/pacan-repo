in this video I want to show you the progress of what Mikolai has been building in the last 8 months so before we start I want to ask Mikolai what is your niche so I basically help high school students with efficient learning with planning with time management mindset stuff and so on m can you briefly explain uh the progression of your journey where you started so basically I started working with Mak I think eight months ago or something like it and at the beginning I didn't know what to do to be honest so I asked M for help we started working together and at the beginning we started with the VSSL funnel because it was the I think the easiest one at the beginning for someone who yeah doesn't have any experience uh we launch by the way this is the financial performance of the funnel so Mich I think that's $25,000 revenue uh first month we actually broke even cuz it takes a while to get going then the the next month we actually made the same but then on the cash uh we actually profited minus about a 100 bucks but then the finally uh the final month he scaled to 30,000 cash collected at the net profit is actually 10,000 because the clients from last month's they were retainer and the reason that we went not directly to build the SAS platform but instead I told him to get clients is the market insights like you how many phone calls did you have with people i think over 100 over 100 phone calls yeah so this is a tracking sheet we used to track every single phone call and like the outcome the objection what kind of price M said right and then um so what what happened you've got six plus four plus two you you got 12 high ticket retainer clients and then I decided that we might switch to something else because it took me too much time and to be honest I'm not a person who likes to talk directly to people so I was thinking of building something uh that would work on autopilot and give me more time to also work on this as well so we decided to switch to the webinar funnel i think one month after uh finishing the sales calls we already made this funnel profitable so we actually launched the funnel and then the first month we literally launched it the next day we got four times returns the day after we got almost 8x returns and by the end of the month we had 2x profit and then I think we stayed at around 2x uh we had a small dip here in April but then last month it was 2.7 and Mikola has broken 150,000 which is this many dollars it's it's 40,000 per month from it and once we've done that by the way guys I can als I can also show you the tracker so we've actually tracked all the sales and all the leads because Mikolai does not do much organic mikolai doesn't have any brand right you started as a as a complete beginner nobody knew about you in Poland right that's right yeah so we got we got sales we literally got 100% of sales through Facebook 98% of people they really join from the ads yeah that's all we done we we just we just launched and I think at the beginning you just launched text ads like you did not even record any videos right yes yes yes this was a long text uh ju just long form text which you can generate using AI nowadays and uh a bunch of images and that's it this is the sales page for the course and nowadays uh this is the actual SAS platform that Mola has launched can you maybe share your screen so it's its goal is to basically help teenagers in Poland to learn more efficiently and to become the best version of them themselves using the tools that we have here so we have four tools so far the first one is planner so it's really simple you basically have to like select the subject and select the exam date and you will get your learning plan right away uh you AI yes using AI basically so you'll basically know what to do when to do and your only task is to basically complete the exercises that I that are here you have also the answer that you can check and basically after completing such a learning plan you almost like with 100% will have your exam passed and you will get a really really good good grade that's one feature second feature is your like calendar uh it's something similar it's like a domination plan in English I think uh and we basically can track all of our activities here so basically I track my time using the calendar i think it's really useful tool for like everyday life uh next we also have a AI assistant for high school students so it's basically programmed to answer as a t tutor with all the instructions with all the additional info so it's like almost the uh current like ch but it's configured especially for high school students how long did it take you to build the SAS so I built the foundation like a few months ago but then I when I focused like 100% on building the SAS it took me like one month maybe one and a half month to build like everything from scratch really like myself and AI yeah oh so like one one month of focused effort while you were running uh the webinar funnel and Micholite does not have any like he's the only person in the whole business plus his girlfriend is helping you out plus as of recently you've got like one guy to help you with the video editing but before it was just you and your girlfriend so while you were taking care of the webinar that means recording ads uh doing customer support like doing all bunch of stuff for that funnel you also had time to code this and it only took you about a month of full focus that's right yeah yeah and the webinar gives you a very nice profit so basically you cover all the costs how much did it does it cost you to run this SAS platform so it's not really a lot so it's like 100 bucks monthly maybe 150 bucks monthly with all the emails that we sent with all the SMS reminders that we sent and so on 150 bucks a month which is this is crazy can you can you show us uh briefly the coding environment yeah I use the IntelligJ for coding i use the cloth code to help me with some things i also experimented with the cascade so it's a wind surf uh but I switched to cloud code because I think that it generates better answers yeah there's so many different tools but like the bottom line is nowadays you don't really need to code line by line you just type in the tool hey can you make this feature for me and it can populate the entire structure so meaning it can create multiple classes for you multiple functions it has a varess it connects things together how how much would you say it would take you without AI versus with AI i think at least like three times more without the AI so that is Mikolai but hope you guys enjoyed
