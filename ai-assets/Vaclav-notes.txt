Misconceptions:
- "Investors will try to find opportunities" > "Investors will try to find reasons why NOT to invest"
- "Raising = building" > With capital, you're buying speed. Not figuring out what you are doing (that's why you need MVP beforehand).
- "Investors are here to make money on dividents" > "Investors make money on selling your company or products in the next 3-8 years to be worth 5-10X more, not 2-3X more."
- "Investors care for good companies" > "Investors look for outliers."
- "Getting an investor is a win" > "It's just a part of the puzzle"

Key takeaways:
- Venture capital is between angel investing/syndicates and private equity.
	They look for things having traction that they can later sell, put on IPO etc. for a multiple.
- In the beginning it's actually easier to look for angel investors or accelerators.
	Angel investor (FFF=friends, family, "fools?"): Invest little (50-100k) but take 10-20% equity
	Accelerator (y-combinator): Up to 10%
	+Upside: Get your foot in the door for niches that need startup capital
	-Downside: Won't be able to do other rounds of investing because you already gave a lot of % of the compamny
- STRATEGY > INVESTORS
- Series A: You can lose up to 50% of your company (if not more) > depends on amount of cofounders etc.
- GIVE THEM THE GRAPH IMAGE (ownership evolution, valley of death)
- Investors love obvious pain (they understand) and clear solution.
	Keep it simple, one liner.
	"Predictability, not fairytales"
- Investors hate techy blurbs (nobody understands).
	"Oh we're the Uber for food", "Tinder for animals" > sounds dumb
	"We're for everyone/trillion dollar market" > you don't even know how to get 1% of the market lol
		So much harder to get 1% of banking than 10% in some niche w/ great product-market fit
		Back it up with data

What you need know:
- A founder-market fit: Focus on founder-market fit and early momentum = recurring revenue, referals, virality
- A story: Why your feature is inevitable and the investor should be a part of > BUT this alone won't get you the investor, you need traction

What you don't need:
- A super duper techy product and NO traction

Decisions to start:
- Do you want to build it yourself?
- Is taking other peoples' money something you want to do?
	- Do you want to give away 40-50% of your company? Do you really need that much money?
	i.e. if you got 5M€ right now, you would not be able to multiply it 10X
		YOU WOULD MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS IF YOU GOT 2K
		—> you need to develop ability to be resourcefull
		–> too much money can make you make dumb decisions
	- Ideally: Do yourself at the beginning (to a certain degree).
- Bootstrapping: Slower, but it's controlled, profitable and you keep ownership
	I.e. bootstraps for 5 years, sells for 5M, sells for 4.5M (before taxes)
- VC-backed: Fast, you have external control to a degree, dilluted revenue, you'll have pressure
	Some people need "good" pressure to succeed
	I.e. raises 20M, exits for 100M, but owns 3% of the company by that time, takes home 3M
	> if you wanna hang out with the big sharks
	> if you want to build a billion dollar business
	"if you want to play the big league, go VC"
- Are you building a rocket or a profitable machine?

- Selling growth and traction works better than hopeful pitch > noone wants to work with desperate people
- Don't let others discourage you or convince you to do something you know is not right for you > what are their reasons/incentives
