Webinar Notes


* Intro: Watch out for fake case studies
   * Watch out for the bullshit. A lot of these crazy stories have either moat or extremely technically skilled co-founder:
      * https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/a-vibe-coded-app-made-3-million-in-48-hours-says-lovable-ceo/ -> truth is they are a big company, big brand, just added a feature to their existing product
* Show the dream: Cursor story $0 to 100M ARR in 12 Months
   * Show the story
* Objection: But HOW can you do it? 
   * No skills, beginner, maybe you just want to scale to 10k MRR, many of you want more but don’t have an idea how
   * Plus you don’t want to give away 50% of your company to investors…
   * The better way: Mikolaj $0 to 40k MRR in 8 months
      * Epiphany #1: Mikolaj did not start with an app
         * Old way: Need investors, build for 12 months, then launch, lose money
         * New way: 1-man team, cashflow positive day one, vibe coding your funnel, not even paying for subscriptions (no clickfunnels etc)
         * Mikolaj made a VSL first, got people on the phone call, understood the market, their objects
         * After getting 12 high ticket, retainer paying clients, he THEN converted the funnel into a webinar (saved hours of time on sales calls) and FINALLY ONLY AFTER THAT started to build his saas
         * Mindset shift: Cashflow first, bootstrap is ok, no need to rush for funding
         * -> Show his funnels and saas
      * Show other successful people: Sam Ovens
         * Show my video with him from 2020 when he was building Skool
         * He got consulting.com profitable, saved 10M and bootstrapped skool AFTER
         * Again, cashflow positive first
         * Forced all of his students to use skool to test adoption and optimize before going mass market
* Vibe coding truth: Not yet ready for end-to-end SaaS, at some point you got to become techy OR hire an engineer
   * Vibe coding is not yet production ready. Can’t make end-to-end saas apps. Still cumbersome. 
      * The micro-SaaS route is a trap for 90% of non-techy audience. They'll build some bullshit PDF generator, make $500/month, and get stuck.
   * BUT, it’s powerful enough to design your front-end. And all you need is a simple sales funnel to start making money.
   * Epiphany #2: Vibe code the funnel (VSL, webinar optins, sales pages), not the app itself!
* A quick demo
   * Show them how to build a registration page to get leads, or get people on a phone call, or even how to build a fully functional front-end
* The path forward
   * For techy founders: Simple, "boring" SaaS apps solving specific business problems are generating $5K-50K monthly recurring revenue
   * For non techy founders: High ticket VSL or a webinar offer, scale it to 20-40k/mo and THEN hire 1-2 devs to build the SaaS.
* The pitch
   * We’re offering an accelerator, end-to-end help, the biggest difference from us vs the VCs is that we don’t take a percentage of your company, you gonna have 12-month access to our platform, support, 2X weekly Q&As, market insights every week, you can leave at any time
* Objections handling
   * How to find ideas > Requests For Startups, Claude Research
   * Do I need money
   * How much time
   * Do I need skillset
