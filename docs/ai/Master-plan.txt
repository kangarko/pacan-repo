Niches


Small startups (CEOs/C-suite) > narrowest positioning, highest price


* Segment:
   * Pre-seed AI startups stuck in validation limbo
* Problem:
   * Sales processes become especially problematic for non-technical founders
   * CMP bump > Customer acquisition costs destroy unit economics


Engineers


* Segment: 
   * First-time founders or ex-employees looking to build something real
   * Indie hackers with unfinished projects or early traction
* Problem:
   * Non-technical founders face technical debt, lack of monetization knowhow, and defensive moats that evaporate overnight when AI company releases a new feature
   * Vendor lock: Anyone building a multi million dollar app on a closed ecosystem is risking everything if the platform changes (i.e. Skool)
      * “Bubble costs us more in hosting than our office rent making it almost impossible for us to sell it to a client”
   * API zero moat: Dependency on third-party APIs creates zero moat against competitors
   * Technical debt accumulated from lacking AI coding tools (security, hidden bugs etc)
   * Pricing with each API costs > different from traditional high margin SaaS


Beginners (bizop) > broadest position, still can do high ticket


* Segment:
   * Anyone who wants a real shot at cashflow, investment, or exit — without BS
   * Techy beginners looking to make money only with SaaS 
   * Creators, engineers, and marketers who want to launch a side-biz
   * Niche jumpers, avid buyers > “you’ve tried XYZ, don't waste your time, do this AI thing + show proof of no code startups getting to millions”
      * > how do we want them to feel?
      * > reason to believe = screenshots of companies raised millions of dollars, successful founder example
      * > fomo > avoid getting stuck at the end useless on minimum income in a few years
      * > sell the alternative > build a saas using AI agent > get 10k/mo
* Problem:
   * Anyone can build an AI startup today. But almost no one knows how to monetize, defend, or sell it.
   * Market saturation:
      * In 2024, chatbots and image editing apps comprised "almost the entire list of top 30 AI apps by global downloads

🟩 Frontend Program: “Vibe To Exit”


We help you go from idea → MVP → first $10K MRR → ready to raise or exit


Price: 1-2k (tiered access) plus recurring community
Audience: Broad — solo founders, ex-tech employees, indie hackers, early-stage startup builders


Message


* Full “incubator” like experience (from 0 to 10k MRR)
* We help you go from idea → MVP → first $10K MRR → ready to raise or exit
* We help you identify a real problem, build an AI-powered product that solves it, and turn it into a sellable business — in 12 months or less. No fluff, no guesswork, no code needed.
* We help people build lean, profitable tech companies with no employees — because today, being small is the new unfair advantage. You don’t need to code. You don’t need a team. All you need is the right idea, the right tools — and the roadmap.
* Just like the creator economy let anyone launch a YouTube channel or IG brand… the AI wave now lets anyone become a tech founder.
* We help you build an AI startup you can actually sell.
* From MVP to your first $10K MRR to a buyer in 12 months.
* If you’ve ever wanted to launch a startup — this is your moment.
* You don’t need to raise VC. You need one good product and one strategic buyer.


Funnel Flow


1. Ad / Organic content → Free Workshop / VSL / Challenge
   1. Funnel: Live webinar > then prerecorded to a $997-2k offer > annual skool? downsell can be monthly 
2. After 4–6 weeks, upsell to Mastermind (by application or post-webinar)
   1. Or downsell to monthly sub
