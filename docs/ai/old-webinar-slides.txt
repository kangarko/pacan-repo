AVOIDING THE TRAP
If you're an engineer, have a Team, Talent and Time,
sure, use AI to build an end-to-end SaaS app - and
we'll show you how to do that too... BUT:

TAKING A DIFFERENT ROUTE
For the most of us, we need to take a different route
(that nobody is talking about)

SAM OVENS
First year lost 10k

Skool (bootstrapped)

SnapInspect

Custom LMS platform

Consulting & 1:1 clients

Webinar

Sam Ovens bootstrapped Skool from 10M of his own money. He already made over 44M
from selling consulting and online courses at Consulting.com where he learned his niche's
painpoints, problems and objections. He then hired two developers to build Skool.com,
launched it to his existing brand and only then went public.

HOW DO I KNOW THAT?

I know Sam since 2018, was a part of Skool beta in 2020

10M TO BOOTSTRAP

#1 EPIPHANY

Mikolaj and Sam
didn't start with
SaaS...

Vibe To Exit: Webinar 1.0

Page 25 of 75

They started by engaging the market 1:1
(VSL, consulting, agency)...

Vibe To Exit: Webinar 1.0

Page 26 of 75

HERE'S WHAT NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT:
Sam and Mikolaj got people on the phone first... they
then learned about their objections, fears and
desires and understood their target market deeply.
If you're an expert, great, but the niche does not give
a single flying f*ck about that! People care about
getting their problems fixed not the person who does
it for them.

Vibe To Exit: Webinar 1.0

Most importantly, they were profitable quickly
and it costed them little to none to start.

Mikolaj, after getting 12 high-ticket, retainer clients
paying him every month, he THEN converted his offer
into a course and ONLY AFTER THAT launched his SaaS.

WE DO CASHFLOW FIRST
Without hard-costs: Speak with people cost $0.
With minimum past experience needed: You will
learn to understand your niche on the phone call.
Without months before launching: You can start in
48h (and we'll show you how to do it today).
Without giving away 50% or more of your company
to investors: You keep 100% of the profit

MOST IMPORTANTLY, THOUGH...
You will be building a brand and your own product
Which means not relying on copying gurus or someone
else's stuff (affiliate marketing, dropshipping, MLM,
appointment setting > fake lifestyle, ending on
Coffeezilla, 30% refund rate, Stripe ban, FTC lawsuit...)

WHICH MEANS
Compound interest for life instead of opportunistic
thinking: “Eight wonder of the world” -Einstein)
Moat: If your business can be cloned by a Shopify
template, you don't have a “business”.

THE TRUTH ABOUT
VIBE CODING

Vibe To Exit: Webinar 1.0

Page 34 of 75

Vibe To Exit: Webinar 1.0

Page 35 of 75

After spending >300M tokens on bolt.new, countless of hours with
Lovable, Bubble, v0.dev, and many other “magic” tools, I realized this....

VIBE CODING IS NOT YET READY
TO MAKE A SAAS FOR YOU.

Just because it works it doesn't mean it's secure, stable and
production-ready.

TURNS OUT, VIBE CODING IS
ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD AT:

Front-end

Funnels

Copywriting

Ideation

Prototyping

Design

Vibe code the funnel (VSL, webinar
optin, sales pages, mockup, demo), not
the app itself!

TWO PATHS
Tech founder with

Non-tech founder / no

market fit:

market fit:

If you have the skill,

Get profitable first, solve

market insights, and are

founder-market fit, save

ready to test your idea

capital and hire talent to
build SaaS

= Build SaaS
= 1:1/VSL/2KA then SaaS

Two paths:
1 - For tech-based founders: If you already have the skill, the market insights, and are
ready to test your idea, go pre-sell it and build your SaaS right away (10% of audience).
2 - For the rest of us, get profitable first by working with people 1:1 or providing them a
service (done-for-them), learn about your market, save capital and hire talent to build
SaaS AFTER you're profitable.
