# Plan for Creating Attachment Style Visualizations

## 1. Četiri stila privrženosti (Four Attachment Styles Diagram)

### Implementation Approach
- Create using SVG for clarity and scalability
- Layout: 2x2 grid structure showing four quadrants
- Each quadrant will represent one attachment style:
  - Sigurna privrženost (Secure)
  - Anksiozna privrženost (Anxious)
  - Izbjegavajuća privrženost (Avoidant)
  - Dezorganizirana privrženost (Disorganized)

### Technical Details
- Use soft, professional colors (blues, greens)
- Include iconic representations for each style
- Add text labels in Croatian
- Include brief descriptive text for each quadrant
- Dimensions: 800x800 viewBox

## 2. Infografika razvoja privrženosti (Attachment Development Infographic)

### Implementation Approach
- Create timeline-based visualization using SVG
- Vertical progression showing key developmental stages
- Include age ranges and developmental milestones

### Technical Details
- Timeline structure with connecting elements
- Icons representing each developmental stage
- Color-coded sections for different age ranges
- Include key milestones:
  - 0-6 months: Initial bonding
  - 6-12 months: Stranger anxiety
  - 12-24 months: Secure base behavior
  - 2-5 years: Internal working models
  - 5+ years: Complex attachment patterns

## 3. Neurobiološki procesi (Neurobiological Processes Illustration)

### Implementation Approach
- Create anatomical brain diagram using SVG
- Focus on key regions involved in attachment:
  - Amygdala
  - Hippocampus
  - Prefrontal cortex
  - Hypothalamus

### Technical Details
- Cross-sectional view of the brain
- Color-coded regions
- Overlay showing hormone pathways:
  - Oxytocin
  - Vasopressin
  - Cortisol
- Include labels in Croatian
- Add arrows showing interaction pathways

## 4. Rezultati istraživanja (Research Results Graph)

### Implementation Approach
- Create interactive bar chart using React and Recharts
- Show distribution of attachment styles in population
- Include comparative data if available

### Technical Details
- Horizontal bar chart
- Color-coded bars for each attachment style
- Include percentage values
- Add hover effects for detailed information
- Show:
  - General population distribution
  - Cross-cultural comparisons if available
  - Age group variations if available

## Implementation Order
1. Start with Four Attachment Styles diagram as foundation
2. Create Development Timeline next to establish progression
3. Develop Neurobiological illustration
4. Finally, create Research Results visualization

## Technical Requirements
- SVG for static illustrations
- React/Recharts for interactive elements
- Consistent color scheme across all visuals
- Responsive design considerations
- Croatian language labels with possible English subtitles
- Export options for different formats/sizes

## Quality Assurance
- Verify medical accuracy of neurobiological representation
- Ensure cultural sensitivity in iconic representations
- Confirm accurate translation of technical terms
- Test readability at different scales
- Validate color choices for accessibility

## Notes
- All text will be in Croatian
- Design should be culturally appropriate
- Include references to source material
- Maintain consistent style across all visualizations
